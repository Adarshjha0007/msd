                Dhoni stepped down as captain of India in the limited over formats in January 2017, just ahead of
                the ODI series at home against England. In the second game of the series, he scored 134 off 122
                balls, that included a 256-run partnership for the fourth wicket along with Yuvraj Singh. The
                century, his tenth in ODIs, was his first in over three years. He was named as a wicketkeeper
                of the <samp>'Team of the Tournament'</samp> at the 2017 Champions Trophy by Cricbuzz. He was also
                named in
